# Advent of Code by Alex L.B.

This is my repo for solving advent of code problems.

## AoC_template

This executable generates a .cpp file and two data files for a specific year and day

Command line args : 
- `-output_path`: The root path to put the files
- `-year`: The year to create a template for
- `-day`: The day to create a template for

## Helpers

There is a helper for the benchmark (mostly time): `DayPartHandler` and one to read and parse data in a more OO style: `FileParser`

## Existing AoC

I currently have worked on these AoC years:

- [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)
